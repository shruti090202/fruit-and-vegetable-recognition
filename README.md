# fruit-and-vegetable-recognition
Python, Machine Learning, Computer Vision

This project proposes a computer vision system for automatically identifying fruits
and vegetables in images, assessing their freshness condition (fresh or rotten),
and measuring their dimensions in centimeters. The system leverages efficient
image processing and object detection algorithms, including the use of
pre-trained deep learning models

First, execute the recognition_model file and download the recognition pre-trained model. After downloading both models you are good to execute the main code.
NOTE: In the code change the path of the models and the dataset to wherever you have stored it.
